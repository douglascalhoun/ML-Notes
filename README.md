# ML Notes

Data science: any profession dealing with data (including AI & ML). An interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains.

Artificial intelligence: computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence
  - visual perception
  - speech recognition
  - decision-making
  - language translation

Sub-disciplines
  - Reasoning, problem solving
  - Knowledge representation
  - Planning
  - Learning
  - Natural language processing
  - Perception
  - Motion and manipulaion
  - Social intelligence
  - General intelligence

Applications:
  - Autonomous vehicles (drones, self-driving cars)
  - Medical diagnosis
  - Creating art (visual, poetry)
  - Proving mathematical theorems
  - Playing games (Chess, Go, Starcraft)
  - Search engines
  - Online assistants
  - Image recognition
  - Spam filtering
  - Prediction of judicial decisions
  - Targeting online advertisements

Machine Learning: algorithms trained on data to learn patterns to make predictions. The use and development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and draw inferences from patterns in data.
